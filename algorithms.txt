#1.
Algorithm: get integer ,add 5 to the integer, double it and subtract 7 from it


Pseudocode:
Prompt user for integer number
get input number
result=((input number  + 5) *2)-7
display result


IPO Diagram
input:      an integer



process:   add 5 to the integer, double it and subtract 7 from it



output:     a new integer

contro structure: a sequence control structure will be followed

Variable required: two interger varible for the input and the output will be required

Testing the solution

let integer be 5 , then (5+5) *2 -7=13


#2

Algorithm: 

get three number , add them and then print result

Pseudocode

prompt user for three number
get three inputnumber
add three inputnumber
display result


IPO Diagram

input:      three numbers



process:   add three of the input numbrs



output:     a new number


contro structure: a sequence control structure will be followed

Variable required: four double varibles for the input and the output will be required

Testing the solution

let numbers be: 10 20 30
                 10+20+30 =60
				 

#3 Algorithm:
     get ten exam scores 
     add ten exam scores 
	 get the sumtotoal 
	 divide the sumtotal by ten
	 display the  result
	 
	Pseudocode:
  prompt user for ten exam scores
  get ten examScore
  sumTotal= added ten examScore
  result= sumTotal/10
  display result
	
	 IPO Diagram

input:      ten exam scores



process:   add ten exam scores , divide the sumtotal by ten 



output:     result


contro structure: a sequence control structure will be followed

Variable required: eleven double varibles

#4

Algorithm:
get dimension of roof footprint
get inches of rainfall
convert rooffootprint to inches,
 multiply the length and width to get roof dimension
multiply roof dimension by inchesof rainfall
divide cubic inches of water by 231
print the result

pseudocode

prompt user for length of roof footprint
prompt user for width of roof footprint
prompt user for inches of rainfall
get legnthOfFootprint
get widthOfFootprint
get rainfallamount
calculated dimensionIninches= legnthOfFootprint * 12* widthOfFootprint *12
calculated runoff=dimensionIninches* rainfallamount
calculated rainfallInGallon=runoff/231
display rainfallInGallon

input:      dimension of the root of footprint, rainfallamount



process:   convert the roof footprint into inches, multiply it with rainfall amount , divide by 231 to convert it to gallon



output:     runoff in gallon

contro structure: a sequence control structure will be followed

Variable required: six double varibles
